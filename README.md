**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Gikai Andrews**

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

Link to project: (https://glitch.com/edit/#!/the-guessing-game)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [+] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [+] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [+] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [+] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [+] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [+] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [+] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [+] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [+] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [+] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [+] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!
- [+] Changed the background color of the game from grey to blue just for style.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
-  Douglas Jones: he is my uncle working as a software engineer.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
- A challenge that I have encountered in creating this submission was getting several syntax errors because I missed some semicolons. As we all know in the basics of programming, a semicolon tells that the current statement has been terminated and other statements following are new statements. I already knew to put the semicolons after every single statement, but I tend to forget to put the semicolon on certain lines. When I tried to preview the code I typed, it just showed the code on the page itself. Also, another challenge that I encountered with this submission was dealing with the buttons. The button was not displaying the colors I set it to when I set it to activate so that took a little bit of time to figure out as well. I overcame these challenges by going over the code with my uncle. Since he is experienced in software engineering, he was useful to me but I wanted to do the code by myself. He only came to me if I had any questions or errors. When I came to him with the syntax errors at first, my uncle and I went through the code together and I did miss some semicolons on certain lines of code. For the button situation, we went through each line of code for the  activation. I did miss some of the hashtags and brackets that were needed for the buttons so it can display the buttonsâ€™ color properly. It was challenging for the most part but it was definitely fun.

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- After completing the submission, one question I have is what does the workload look like when a web developer is working on numerous projects at once. I assume it varies depending on how many projects a web developer takes at a time. Another question that I have is how many revisions are there when it comes to working on a project because of the time constraints and as well depending on the client, the client could give a certain amount of revisions. Another question I have is when you plan on developing a website, do you usually create a storyboard to map out where everything goes?  


4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
- If I had a few more hours to work on this project, I would have added a timer in the project between every round. As for the style aspect, I would implement a photo that can correlate with the background of the game but it would not be too flashy.It can be a moving image or static, either or works. Also, I would like to put in some background music just so the game can keep you engaged before you start the game. I would like to also change the shape of each button so they can be different from each other.
